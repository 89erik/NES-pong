My summer project for learning some general assembly 
and low level programming, and of course to program
for the NES.

bounce.nes is readily compiled and can be run in a 
NES emulator like Nintendulator or Nestopia.

At the moment bounce.asm is the main source file. 
It includes main.asm which contains the main loop,
init.asm containing the code for initialization and
constants.inc (contains constants!).
